			<h3>An intro to Monique</h3>
			<p>
				Hello! Welcome to my website, I am Monique, a rather awkward human who is just trying to do her best.  I enjoy a lot of little things in life like animals, video games, sleeping and food. I am excited to be in the IASC program and to learn a lot. My birthday is February 20th.

			<h3>Musicals</h3>
			<p>
				Monique really really enjoys music, especially musicals. She has been interested in Musicals as long as she can remeber and has always tried to be a part of them whenever she could. While Monique did small shows in elementary school it was not until high school that she started to really get into Musical Theatre, getting to play Sebastian in her high school production of The Little Mermaid.This affinity for music and musicals continues to grow and Monique can be found listening to music at almost any time of the day.

			<h3>Books</h3>
			<p>
				Monique also likes to read, her 2 favourite series are Uglies by Scott Westerfeld and Keeper of the Lost Cities by Shannon Messenger. Both of which she was tasked to read in Battle Of The Books in grade 8 and has stuck with ever since. The Uglies series has since finished but a new book set in the same universe came out recently (as of writing) and has made her very excited. Keeper of the Lost Cities is an ongoing series and the 7th book came out recently. She is very excited to read both.

			<h3>Disney</h3>
			<p>
				Monique also thoroughly enjoys Disney, she finds it all very whimsical and enjoys watching the movies rather frequently. Truly a child at heart.
